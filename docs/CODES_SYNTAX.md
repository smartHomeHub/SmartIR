# SmartIR Devices Codes Files syntax

## Disclaimer

- I do not provide any support for you to record your own device codes. Please do not create any issues to ask how to do it as it will immediately closed.
- [You can ask for help at SmartIR Climate (Home Assistant Community)](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/smartir-control-your-climate-tv-and-fan-devices-via-ir-rf-controllers/).

## Device codes JSON file

If you decide to modify or create your own device file you need to do it in the `custom_codes/[climate|fan|media_player|/` directory. Any changes inside `codes` directory will be lost upon SmartIR HACS update!

- If you need to modify existing file from the `codes` directory please copy it into `custom_codes` first.
- If you need to create new device file please choose free for digit file name (not used by existing json file int the `codes/your_class` directory) and create json file with given name in the `custom_codes/your_class`

Each different class (Climate, Fan, Media Player) device file has common part and then class specific part. Please take look to some existing files as examples. It is very easy to make error in JSON file structure when editing. Use any available JSON format checker to validate it after editing - for example [JSON Lint](https://jsonlint.com/)

### Climate commands

Now when all modes supported by your device (operation, presets, fan, swing) are declared, you need to records IR command for their combination for any target temperature. There may be some tools to help you to help with such process.

#### Climate `off` commands

Most of the controler devices have single `off` command, which is used to switch device off. In some more rare cases, there is different command for each operational mode device is currently working in. So for `cool` operational mode there could be `off_cool` command, for `heat` operational mode `off_heat`, etc. You need to have either `off` command or `off_MODE` command for all you operational codes declared.

```yaml:
    "commands": {
        "off": "JgCSAAABKHQKDGgDTFS.............",
```

or

```yaml:
    "commands": {
        "off_cool": "JgCSAAABKHQKDGgDEht.............",
        "off_heat": "JgCSAAABKHQKDGgDFth.............",
        "off_dry": "JgCSAAABKHQKDGgDFht.............",
        ...
```

#### Climate `on` commands

In some cases, controled device have dedicated `on` command (Otherwise device is switched on by the operation command and dedicated IR code to switch it on is not required). In case your `on` and `off` command are same, SmartIR not send `on` or `off` command again, if the device is assumed to be already in desired state. As without power sensor devices state is only assumed it is higly suggested to use in this case power sensor feature.

```yaml:
    "commands": {
        "on": "JgCSAAABKHQKDGgHtSq.............",
```

#### Climate operation commands

These are command to set controlled device into desired work state. Due to the nature how HVAC units works, all the modes and temperature are contained in single IR command. Therefore you need to records and declare IR commands for the all combinations of the modes and temperatures. The complete structure would look like:

`operation mode` -> `preset mode` -> `fan mode` -> `swing mode` -> `temperature` -> `recorded IR command`

```yaml:
    "commands": {
        "cool": {
            "eco": {
                "low": {
                    "swing": {
                        "16": "JgCSAAABKZIXEBcRFz.............",
                        "17": "JgCSAAABKHQKDGgDHz.............",
                        ...
                    },
```

- If your device doesn't support some of the modes types at all (and you did not declare them in the declaration part - for example presetModes are not supported) then simply skip given level (`operation mode` -> `fan mode` -> `swing mode` -> `temperature` -> `recorded IR command`). Only `operation mode` level is required, all lower levels are optional.

```yaml:
    "commands": {
        "cool": {
            "low": {
                "swing": {
                    "16": "JgCSAAABKZIXEBcRFz.............",
                    "17": "JgCSAAABKHQKDGgDHz.............",
                    ...
                },
```

- If you device doesn't support some mode under given higher level mode (for example temperatures are not supported under fan_only operation mode, or presetModes are not supported under dry operation mode), you have three possibilities how to address this:

  1. Use `-` as 'catch all' mode name/temperature. Using this approach has additional behavior - if you change mode/temperature which to the value covered by `-` the value will not change in the HA. Example: temperatures are not supported under fan_only operation mode - when you will try to change temperature using `-` key the temperature in HA stays same:

  ```yaml:
  "commands": {
      "fan_only": {
          "-": {
              "low": {
                  "swing": {
                      "-": "JgCSAAABKZIXEBcRFz............."
                  },
  ```

  2. Define some default mode (i.e. something like `none` or `default` but any name will do) as first in the declaration section and use it as default failover mode. Example: if you are running for example in the operation mode `cool` with preset mode `eco` and you change operation mode to `dry` which doesn't support presets, then it will try to select first available preset in the order presets are declared in the `presetModes` - and it will therefore choose your first one - `none`:

  ```yaml:
  "commands": {
      "cool": {
          "eco": {
              "low": {
                  "swing": {
                      "16": "JgCSAAABKZIXEBcRFz............."
                  },
          ...
      "dry": {
          "none": {
              "low": {
                  "swing": {
                      "16": "JgCSAAABKZIXEBcRFz............."
                  },
  ```

  3. Duplicate same IR command to all keys. This approach is not suggested and multiple occurence of the same IR command will be logged by the validator to the HA log. Example: temperature setting is not supported in the fan_only mode and all commands are same:

  ```yaml:
  "commands": {
      "fan_only": {
          "normal": {
              "low": {
                  "swing": {
                      "16": "JgCSAAABKZIXEBcRFz.............",
                      "17": "JgCSAAABKZIXEBcRFz.............",
                      "18": "JgCSAAABKZIXEBcRFz.............",
                      ...
                  },
  ```
