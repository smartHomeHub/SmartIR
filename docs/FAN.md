For this platform to work, we need a .json file containing all the necessary IR or RF commands.
Find your device's brand code [here](FAN.md#available-codes-for-fan-devices) and add the number in the `device_code` field. The compoenent will download it to the correct folder. If your device is not working, you will need to learn your own codes and place the .json file in `smartir/codes/fan/` subfolders. Please note that the `device_code` field only accepts positive numbers. The .json extension is not required.

## Configuration variables:
**name** (Optional): The name of the device<br />
**unique_id** (Optional): An ID that uniquely identifies this device. If two devices have the same unique ID, Home Assistant will raise an exception.<br />
**device_code** (Required): ...... (Accepts only positive numbers)<br />
**controller_data** (Required): The data required for the controller to function. Enter the IP address of the Broadlink device **(must be an already configured device)** or the MQTT topic on which to send commands.<br />
**power_sensor** (Optional): *entity_id* for a sensor that monitors whether your device is actually On or Off. This may be a power monitor sensor. (Accepts only on/off states)<br />

## Example (using broadlink controller):
```yaml
smartir:

switch:
  - platform: broadlink
    host: 192.168.10.10
    mac: '00:00:00:00:00:00'
    
fan:
  - platform: smartir
    name: Bedroom fan
    unique_id: bedroom_fan
    device_code: 1000
    controller_data: 192.168.10.10
    power_sensor: binary_sensor.fan_power
```

## Example (using mqtt controller):
```yaml
smartir:
    
fan:
  - platform: smartir
    name: Bedroom fan
    unique_id: bedroom_fan
    device_code: 2000
    controller_data: home-assistant/bedroom-fan/command
    power_sensor: binary_sensor.fan_power
```

## Available codes for Fan devices:
Below are the code files created by the people in the community. Before you start creating your own code file, try if one of them works for your device. **Please open an issue if your device is working and not included in the supported models.**
